This final project is a plotter for mathematical function, using primarily C as a frontend with the Ncurses library

TO RUN:
Either, while logged in as the user timsaa, use the alias <plot>
Or, run the python driver file <./driver>

NOTES:
Does not support non-functions (in terms of Y)
Remember to seperate operations with spaces, like such: <x + 2>
The standard graph mode shows the midpoint of the bounds with a line, where each y corresponds to the same x
Since most Terminals are wider than they are high, the function will most likely go past the max or min y value, casuing those parts to be unrendered
To inspect the general charactaristics of the function given the span, use the general mode
The special points view is highly innaccurate, since that would require algebra on a level C cannot handle, take it with a grain of salt.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The general graph view tends to break given extremely large differences in min and max Y, such as functions which involve division over X
